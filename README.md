# Week-4-Game

<!--

Here's a fun crystal game... The computer generates a random number and then the user must click the crystals. 
The goal is for the user to increase their score until it matches the computer generated number by clicking
the crystals...

However, there's a catch. If you go over, you lose. Also, every new game the crystal values randomly reset.
